# EMG Gesture Control

A Python-based EMG gesture control system that reads real-time EMG signals from Arduino via serial, and triggers keyboard inputs using either rule-based logic or a machine learning model.

## Credits / Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by the work of Upsidedownlabs and their open-source neuroscience and EMG projects. Their hardware ecosystem and educational content played a major role in the development of this project.

Their work on EMG sensing, BioAmp hardware, and human-computer interaction projects is highly recommended for anyone interested in biosignal processing and gesture recognition.


## Demo / What it does

`EMG Gesture Control` connects an EMG sensor setup to your PC. It reads live muscle signals, processes them, and translates 3 specfic gestures into keyboard events. The app supports:

- fast non-ML gesture logic
- ML-based prediction with baseline calibration
- auto-switching between modes when a model is available
- live debug output in the terminal
- recording EMG data to CSV
- configurable key mappings and presets via a web UI

## Features

- Real-time EMG signal acquisition over serial
- Dual mode operation:
  - Non-ML threshold-based detection
  - ML model prediction pipeline
- Auto mode selects ML automatically if a model file is present
- Configurable via .env
- EMG data recording to `data/*.csv`
- Preset key mapping support via JSON
- Clean single-line live debug output
- Simple pywebview UI for control and settings

## How it works

### EMG input
The system reads two EMG channels from the Arduino. Each sample is parsed from the serial stream and treated as enveloped EMG signal values.

### Serial communication
app.py opens the serial port configured by `SERIAL_PORT` and `BAUD_RATE`. Incoming lines are decoded, split into values, and passed into the gesture processing loop.

### Non-ML logic
In non-ML mode, the app applies rule-based thresholds to Envelop EMG values:

- one gesture when `env1` is above a low threshold and `env2` stays under a value
- second gestures when `env2` crosses higher thresholds
- third geust
- actions are mapped to keyboard keys with a cooldown to avoid repeat triggers

This mode is fast and useful for basic EMG control without a trained model.

### ML pipeline
In ML mode, the pipeline is:

1. collect a baseline from the first `BASELINE_SAMPLES`
2. compute whether the current EMG signal deviates from baseline
3. build a feature vector (`emg1`, `emg2`)
4. run `model.predict(...)`
5. map the predicted class to a keyboard action

ML mode uses `joblib` to load the model and `pandas` for feature framing.

## Hardware setup [Setup Tutorial](HARDWARE.md)


## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install -r req.txt
```

If you prefer a `requirements.txt`, create one from req.txt or install directly:

```bash
python -m pip install pyserial numpy pandas joblib python-dotenv pywebview keyboard
```

---

## Configuration

COnfigure a .config file in the project root with the following values.

```env
SERIAL_PORT=COM3
BAUD_RATE=115200
FORCE_MODE=auto
MODEL_PATH=models/emg_modelv0.2.pkl
BUFFER_SIZE=64
COOLDOWN_TIME=0.5
WINDOW=1
BASELINE_SAMPLES=300
DEV1=5
DEV2=40
CSV_FILENAME=data.csv
SAVE_INTERVAL=5
```

### .config keys

- `SERIAL_PORT`
  - the Arduino serial port, e.g. `COM3`
- `BAUD_RATE`
  - communication speed, typically `115200`
- `FORCE_MODE`
  - `auto` → auto-selects ML if model exists
  - `ml` → force ML mode
  - `non-ml` → force rule-based mode
- `MODEL_PATH`
  - path to the saved ML model file
- `BUFFER_SIZE`
  - serial smoothing buffer length
- `COOLDOWN_TIME`
  - minimum seconds between triggered key presses
- `WINDOW`
  - ML window size for feature extraction
- `BASELINE_SAMPLES`
  - number of samples collected before ML predictions begin
- `DEV1`
  - baseline deviation threshold for channel 1
- `DEV2`
  - baseline deviation threshold for channel 2
- `CSV_FILENAME`
  - output CSV name when recording
- `SAVE_INTERVAL`
  - seconds between automatic CSV flushes

> Note: non-ML gesture thresholds are currently defined in app.py and can be tuned there if needed.

## Usage

### Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

### Start EMG
- Open the local UI served by `pywebview`
- Choose your key mappings
- Click `Start EMG`

### Key mapping
- Assign actions to physical keys through the UI
- The default mapping is:
  - `action1` → `space`
  - `action2` → `left`
  - `action3` → `right`

---

## Modes Explained

### ML mode
- Loads a trained model from `MODEL_PATH`
- Uses baseline calibration
- Applies prediction on a feature window
- Best for gesture classification after training

### Non-ML mode
- Uses fixed threshold logic
- Fast and lightweight
- Good for prototyping or when a model is unavailable

### Auto mode
- Default mode
- If `MODEL_PATH` exists and loads successfully, ML mode is selected
- Otherwise, falls back to non-ML

## Training your own model

This project includes a ready-made training script (`Logistic_Regression_model.py`) that handles the entire pipeline.

### Step 1: Collect training data

1. Run the main app: `python app.py`
2. In the web UI, enable **Recording** (check the recording checkbox)
3. Perform each gesture multiple times while keeping the recording active
4. The app will save EMG data to `data/data.csv` with this format:

```csv
timestamp,emg1,emg2,label
1735689600.1,245,123,action1
1735689600.2,250,121,action1
1735689600.3,248,125,action2
...
```

5. Stop the app after collecting samples for all desired gestures

### Step 2: Label your data

Open `data/data.csv` and manually set the `label` column for each row:

| Label | Gesture |
|-------|---------|
| `action1` | First gesture (e.g., fist) |
| `action2` | Second gesture (e.g., open hand) |
| `action3` | Third gesture (e.g., relax) |

> **Tip:** You can also add more labels like `action4`, `action5` etc. for additional gestures.

### Step 3: Train the model

Run the training script:

```bash
python Logistic_Regression_model.py
```

This will:
- Load data from `data/data.csv`
- Extract `emg1` and `emg2` as features
- Split data into 80% training / 20% testing
- Train a Logistic Regression classifier with StandardScaler
- Print accuracy score
- If `models/emg_model.pkl` already exists, prompt you for a new filename
- Save the model to the specified path (default: `models/emg_modelv0.3.pkl`)

### Step 4: Use the model

1. Open `.config` and set:
   ```env
   FORCE_MODE=auto
   MODEL_PATH=models/emg_modelv0.3.pkl
   ```
2. Restart `python app.py`
3. The app will automatically load the model and switch to ML mode

### CSV format reference

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | Epoch seconds when sample was recorded |
| `emg1` | Raw EMG value from channel 1 |
| `emg2` | Raw EMG value from channel 2 |
| `label` | Gesture class (`action1`, `action2`, `action3`, etc.) |

### Customizing the training script

If you want to use a different classifier, edit `Logistic_Regression_model.py`:

```python
# Replace LogisticRegression with your choice:
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = make_pipeline(
    StandardScaler(),
    RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
)
```

To change the output model path, modify the last line:

```python
joblib.dump(model, "models/your_model_name.pkl")
```

## Debugging Guide

### Serial issues
- confirm Arduino is connected
- verify `SERIAL_PORT` and `BAUD_RATE`
- check device manager for the correct COM port

### No input detected
- ensure the EMG electrodes are attached correctly
- verify the Arduino sketch is outputting two numeric values per line
- check the terminal for malformed serial lines

### Delay issues
- reduce `COOLDOWN_TIME`
- lower `WINDOW` if ML mode feels too slow
- keep serial baud rate at `115200`

### Model not loading
- make sure `joblib` is installed
- ensure `MODEL_PATH` points to a valid `.pkl`
- inspect error output when the app starts

## Performance Tips

- use `BAUD_RATE=115200`
- keep `BUFFER_SIZE` small for faster responsiveness
- reduce `SAVE_INTERVAL` only if you need frequent CSV writes
- use `non-ml` mode for the lowest latency
- tune `DEV1` / `DEV2` and baseline sample counts for your hardware setup
